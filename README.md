## Tech Stack
* React Native
* Expo
* GraphQL
* React Navigation
* Jest 
* Enzyme
* Ruby on Rails

## Goals
 - Demonstrate knowledge gained throughout Turing
  - Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
 - Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
 - Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
 - Practice an advanced, professional git workflow
 - Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
 - Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
 - Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec
