Minimum Viable Product: 

 - Wanderer facing application allows users to keep track of their upcoming travel plans including trips, legs, lodging and transportation. From there the friendly dashboard shows their current location with weather and the local emergency phone number. Most importantly, Wanderer's are able to add Followers, their loved ones who care for them and worry sometimes. The Wanderers and the Followers are able to ping each other. With each ping sent from a Wanderer to a Follower the Follower receives their Wanderer's current location. In the case of emergency, if the emergency phone number on the Dashboard is dialed all location information captured by the application will be sent to the Wanderer's emergency contact.

 - Follower facing application allows users to view their Wanderer’s trip itinerary details as well as check-in on their loved ones on the road, pinging their Wanderer's request for a check-in.
