# Trex - travel safe & travel often

Trex, your safe travel application, allows users to travel the world all while keeping their loved ones apprized on their travels and their safety. 

## Set Up

### Use the Application

Install [Expo Client](https://expo.io/tools#client) on your mobile device.

Visit [Trex's deployed application]() using your mobile device and when prompted open the application with Expo.

### Developer Setup

Should you be interested in exploring the code a bit further first off, ensure you have the latest update of XCode installed on your machine then:

 - Clone down this directory and cd into it.
 - Enter `npm install -g expo-cli` into the terminal to install Expo from your terminal
 - Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
 - Enter `expo start`
 - Type `i` from the command line to open an iOS simulator
 - Run `npm test` to run the applications front end testing suite


## Description

The problem: The world is a both a beautiful and a dangerous place, in that order.

Exploration is exciting but sometimes loved ones at home are left to worry.

Trex targets two audiences: 
  1) Internet enabled world travelers and
  2) These world traveler’s families and friends

Minimum Viable Product: 

 - Wanderer facing application allows users to keep track of their upcoming travel plans including trips, legs, lodging and transportation. From there the friendly dashboard shows their current location's weather and the local emergency phone number. Most importantly, Wanderer's are able to add Followers, their loved ones who care for them and worry sometimes. The Wanderers and the Followers are able to ping each other. With each ping sent from a Wanderer to a Follower the Follower receives their Wanderer's current location. In the case of emergency, i.e. emergency phone number on the Dashboard is dialed, all location related information captured by the application will be sent to the Wanderer's Follower who is marked their emergency contact.

 - Follower facing application allows users to view their Wanderer’s trip itinerary details as well as check-in on their loved ones on the road, pinging their Wanderer with a request to check-in.

The Trex solution: Travel safe & travel often with Trex so you can keep others up-to-date on your well-being.
